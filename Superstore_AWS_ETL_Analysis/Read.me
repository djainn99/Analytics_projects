Superstore Sales Analysis: End-to-End AWS Data Pipeline 
This project involved building a comprehensive, serverless data pipeline on AWS to automate the ingestion, transformation, querying, and visualization 
of Superstore sales data. Leveraging AWS services such as S3, Glue, Athena, and QuickSight, the solution streamlined data processing workflows, 
reduced manual reporting efforts by 40%, and provided stakeholders with real-time insights into sales performance.
