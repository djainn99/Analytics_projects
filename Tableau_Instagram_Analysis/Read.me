This project aimed to analyze engagement trends on my Instagram account to understand what type of content, post formats, 
and posting days drive the most reach and interaction. I manually collected performance data from 100 posts and organized it 
in Excel before visualizing the insights using Tableau.

Through exploratory visual analysis, I used a variety of charts — including bar graphs, line charts, pie charts, and area plots — 
to compare metrics such as likes, comments, shares, saves, and plays across different content categories (Travel, Pet, Family, etc.) 
and post types (Reels, Photos, Videos, Carousels).

The findings revealed that Reels, Travel, and Pet content perform best, especially when posted on weekdays, leading to significantly 
higher engagement and visibility. Applying these insights to my posting strategy helped me achieve an 80% increase in followers and 
improved overall account growth and consistency.

This project demonstrates how data collection, visualization, and analysis can be applied to social media optimization — transforming 
raw engagement data into actionable strategies for audience growth.
