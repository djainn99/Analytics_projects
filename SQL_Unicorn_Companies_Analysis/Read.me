This project explores global unicorn company data to uncover trends in valuation, funding, and growth patterns using SQL-based analysis. 
Through exploratory queries, I identified the total number of unicorns and countries represented, calculated the average time to reach unicorn status (6.9 years), 
and determined which industries and countries dominate the unicorn landscape — with Fintech, Internet Software, and E-commerce leading the way.

The analysis also revealed top-performing companies by return on investment, highlighting firms like Zapier, Canva, and DJI Innovations, 
and examined the most active investors, such as Accel and Tiger Global Management. This project demonstrates the use of SQL for business intelligence 
— transforming raw startup data into meaningful insights about global innovation trends and funding ecosystems.
